  abstract = {This article presents a new Domain Specific Embedded Language (DSEL) dedicated to Software-Defined Radio (SDR). From a set of carefully designed components, it enables to build efficient software digital communication systems, able to take advan- tage of the parallelism of modern processor architectures, in a straightforward and safe manner for the programmer. In particular, proposed DSEL enables the combination of pipelining and sequence duplication techniques to extract both temporal and spatial parallelism from digital communication systems. We leverage the DSEL capabilities on a real use case: a fully digital transceiver for the widely used DVB-S2 standard designed entirely in software. Through evaluation, we show how proposed software DVB-S2 transceiver is able to get the most from modern, high-end multi- core CPU targets.},
